# Notification Pattern

A basic implementation of the Notification Pattern, as defined by [Martin Fowler](https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/Notification.html), but somewhat adapted to my needs.

## implementation details

- Result Pattern with [CSharpFunctionalExtensions](https://github.com/vkhorikov/CSharpFunctionalExtensions), where the Result object is used like the "Notificiation" object that stores the validation errors;
- Clean Architecture to keep validation logic in the domain layer;
- REST API as the presentation layer;
